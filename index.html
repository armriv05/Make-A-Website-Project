<h1>Best Clash Royale Decks</h1>
<hr> THESE ARE THE BEST CLASH ROYALE DECKS I WILL NOT TAKE ANY COUNTERARGUMENTS. </hr>
<h2> Deck #1 - 2.6 Hog Cycle </h2>
<p style=background-color:Tomato> The First Deck is 2.6 Hog Cycle. This is because althought people will say that it takes 0 skill or it is all spam, you need some form of skill to use it. You need to know when to place a hog or when to save your cycle cards for defence. The main goal of this deck is to cycle hog riders, so that way you can get damage on the opponents towers. You can also spell cycle if needed, as you have two medium spells. <br> <br>This deck contains Hog Rider, the win condition, Ice Spirit, Cannon, Musketeer, Skeletons, Ice Golem, Fireball, and The Log. </p>

<h2> Deck #2 - 2.9 Royal Hog Cycle</h2>
<p style="background-color:Orange;">Although this deck is another cycle deck, this deck uses Royal Hogs instead of Hog Rider, as well as other differences. This deck also uses a champion, the Archer Queen, which allows the user to have a three card cycle when they play the card. This allows for much faster cycling, and allow more royal hogs to be placed in less time. <br> <br> This deck contains Skeletons, Fire Spirit, Archer Queen, Cannon, Earthquake, The Log, Royal Delivery, and the win condition Royal Hogs. </p>

  <h2> Deck #3 - Pekka Bridge Spam </h2>
<p style=background-color:Gray> While this deck has a higher average elixir cost than the other two decks, this deck allows for some cycling if played correctly.

The main goal of this deck is to either spam the bridge with pushes that require the opponent to constantly counter or to create a big push that your opponent can not counter fully.<br> <br> This deck contains Pekka, Electro Wizard, Bandit, Royal Ghost, Battle Ram, Poison, Zap, and Magic Archer. </p>
